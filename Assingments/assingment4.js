// Difference Between MongoDB Server & Node.js Server

// The MongoDB server is responsible for storing and managing data in the MongoDB database. It
// handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations. On the other hand, a Node.js server is a runtime
// environment that executes JavaScript code. It handles incoming requests from clients, processes them, and
// can interact with databases like MongoDB to retrieve or update data. You would use a MongoDB server to
// store and manage data, while a Node.js server is used to handle application logic and serve client requests.


// SQL vs. MongoDB

// SQL databases use structured tables with rows and columns to store data, while MongoDB uses
// flexible and dynamic documents in collections. SQL databases use SQL as a querying language, while
// MongoDB uses a JavaScript-like syntax for queries. SQL databases are suitable for applications with
// well-defined and structured data, such as financial systems. MongoDB is better for projects with changing or
// unstructured data, like content management systems or real-time analytics.
